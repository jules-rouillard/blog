Picture of the Mont Blanc and it's "Chapeau"(lenticular cloud) taken around “Rifugio Bertone” after leaving Courmayeur.

Fun fact : Lenticular cloud form when wind is forced over a mountain ridge or other obstacle, causing air to cool and condense as it moves up the slope. The cloud appears stationary because moisture is constantly evaporating on the downwind side while more condenses on the upwind side. 

Taken during my 7‑day hike of the “Tour du Mont Blanc” in August 2025.
