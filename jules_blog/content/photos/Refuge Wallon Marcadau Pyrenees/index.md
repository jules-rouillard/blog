Picture taken from the camping zone bellow the "Refuge Wallon Marcadau" around 6pm when the sun was setting on the valley. In the center we have "Pic Ruben Pantet" (2867m) on the left and "Pic Arraillous" (2704m) on the right.

Taken during my 6-day hike of the "Tour du grand Vignemale" in 2024.

Zooming in the top half part of the picture focusing more on both Pic great a better picture.
