## Motivation

Most days, I cycle to work, but I live in Ireland, and rain has become an inseparable part of the commute. 

While it is not a big issue as I carry spare clothes and shoes, my gloves and shoes do get wet and donâ€™t dry over the workday. 
To reduce the time it takes to dry, one can use a few tricks. In this case, I went with a bit of ventilation. Having a small airflow can make a big difference especially since the air in the office is not saturated in water.

The goal of the small project was to build a fan that would be controlled by a humidity sensor placed inside gloves/shoes.

## Software and component used

## Defining expected behaviour


### Firmware for communication with the humidity sensor

### MCU code

### Fan control

### Testing

### PCB layout

$$I_{B}=\frac{V_p-V_{BE}}{I_B} $$
