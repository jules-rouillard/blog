I'm Jules, I currently work as an Analogue Design engineer in Ireland.

This blog is for posting about things I am interested in, personal projects and pictures I took.
The post on my personal project serves mainly as my documentation, a record of what I did.
Sharing them can also be helpful for someone. I have been and continue to receive help from free resources that people share online.

Most pictures posted are from a hiking trip. I do love the mountain and nature.
